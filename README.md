## Resources Used

- https://youtu.be/PEHtceu7FBw - CharacterController stick-to-surface script to prevent losing contact with the slope when moving down it. Adapted for... to do more things.
- I think I was mentally referencing the Yo! Noid 2 capsule Noid character when I was implementing the procedural animations? Definitely had it in mind.
- I'm stealing a good amount of code from my last game, [Speedrun FPS](https://github.com/vwheatle/IntroToGameDev-SpeedrunFPS/).
